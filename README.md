# PD-Apartment-Raid
Raid Apartments Via Police JOB | QBCORE NEW
TO HAVE THIS FULLY WORKED ADD THE CLIENT TO THE BUTTOM OF QB-APARTMENTS, you can put the server side where ever you want but i suggest qb-apartment too.

Add More Houses Location Via Client by Editing ApartmentCheck() and targetlocations

To Use this Script you need to have a police job and a higher Grade of 12 you can easily change it in client line 109
then you use the command /pdraid you need to put a minigame of your liking I am using this https://github.com/Nathan-FiveM/qb-lock Minigame at the moment.
than when you Complete it will activate the PD Raid to everyone meaning all of your officers can use the it and raid apartments via the Target Eye.
